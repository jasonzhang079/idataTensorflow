    "- Supervised or Unsupervised\n",
    "    - All data is labeled and the algorithms learn to predict the output from the input data.\n",
    "    - Unsupervised: All data is unlabeled and the algorithms learn to inherent structure from the input data.\n",

    "- A hypothesis is a certain function that we believe (or hope) is similar to the true function, the target function that we want to model. In context of email spam classification, it would be the rule we came up with that allows us to separate spam from non-spam emails.\n",
    "- Model: In machine learning field, the terms hypothesis and model are often used interchangeably. In other sciences, they can have different meanings, i.e., the hypothesis would be the \"educated guess\" by the scientist, and the model would be the manifestation of this guess that can be used to test the hypothesis."
