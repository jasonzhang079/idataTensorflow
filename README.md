##What does ML (supervised) do?
ML systems learn how to combine input to produce useful predictions on never-before-seen data.
Regression vs. classification
A regression model predicts continuous values. For example, regression models make predictions that answer questions like the following:
What is the value of a house in California?
What is the probability that a user will click on this ad?
A classification model predicts discrete values. For example, classification models make predictions that answer questions like the following:
Is a given email message spam or not spam?
Is this an image of a dog, a cat, or a hamster?

##Importance of Machine Learning 
ML will help software engineer to:
- reduce the time you spend programming
- customize the product making them better for the specific groups of people (English spelling corrector -> other language)
- solve problem which have no idea how to do by hand
NOTE: machine change the ways you think about the problem, rather than logically and mathematically, to natural science (analyze the result of experient)
